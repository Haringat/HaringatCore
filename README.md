# Haringat Core

## This is a core mod

This mod is not meant to fulfill any purpose when installed on its own and should be used with my other mods.

## Usage

In order to use this mod you need to download several external dependency jars (you don't need to do this when developing on the mod as gradle is gonna take care of that for you). Here is a (at the time of this writing) complete list with links to version that **SHOULD** work:

 * [Kotlin standard library 1.1.51 for jvm 1.8](http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/jetbrains/kotlin/kotlin-stdlib-jre8/1.1.51/kotlin-stdlib-jre8-1.1.51.jar)
 * [Kotlin coroutines library 0.19.2](http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/jetbrains/kotlinx/kotlinx-coroutines-core/0.19.2/kotlinx-coroutines-core-0.19.2.jar)
 * [Forgelin 0.1.2 for 1.7.10 (must be self-compiled ATM)](https://www.github.com/Haringat/Forgelin)

These should all be dumped in your mods folder alongside Haringat Core.

## Contributing

You wanna help? Awesome! Here's how you can do it.

### Finding bugs and filing issues

If you find a bug in one of my mods just go to its GitHub repository and file an issue under "issues".

You will need a GitHub Account for that but creating one is free.

### Contribute code

***PLEASE NOTICE***: Please create an issue where you describe what you want to change, first so that we can discuss it. That saves us all time in case I can provide you with assistance or I can directly tell you if I happen to dislike your idea.

You can just fork the repository and make changes/improvements on your own fork without interfering with the main repository. Once you are done, just send me a pull request and I will look into it.
